Ich bin Italienerin und wohne dauerhaft in der wunderbaren Stadt München.

Reisen ist meine Leidenschaft. Vor allem liebe ich Afrika, das Meer, Outdoor Abenteuer, leckeres Essen und Kulturhighlights.

Gäste aus aller Welt zu empfangen und ihnen eine stilvolle Wohnung im Herzen von München zu bieten, ist eine der coolsten Sachen überhaupt!
Ich bin ein unkomplizierter Mensch. Als Gastgeberin helfe ich meinen Gästen immer und versuche, ihnen das bestmögliche Erlebnis zu bieten. Da ich oft und gerne reise, verstehe ich, was die Leute von meiner Wohnung erwarten. 

Ich lerne gerne neue Leute kennen, zum Beispiel auf Reisen und jetzt auch zu Hause.
Auf neuen Kontakten und unvergesslichen Eindrücken freue ich mich sehr! 

Ich stehe gerne für Hilfe zur Verfügung und gebe euch gerne Anregungen, wie ihr München von seiner authentischen Seite entdecken könnt.

My friends call me Faissalito! I'm a moroccan guy living in Munich for already more than 17 years. 
I grew up in Casablanca, where african lifestyle meets the fast pace of a metropolis. But I must confess the easy-going way of life corresponds more my way of seeing things ;)
As the ocean has forever been my home, water is my preferred element. I became a passionated bodyboarder over the years. My hobby drives me to travel around the world, always eager to find the perfect spot to surf. 
I love to meet new people from different cultural backgrounds who share their wisdoms about life. Generally open-minded and with a smile on my face, I see airBnB as a perfect opportunity to give everyone the chance to see new places and to make new experiences. I am happy enough to have my own apartment in Munich and excited to share it with you.

Ich bin Felix, 28 Jahre alt und aus dem schönen Bayern. 
Die letzten Jahre habe ich viele Reisen unternommen und unter anderem über Airbnb viele tolle Menschen kennengelernt. Jetzt ist es an der Zeit etwas zurückzugeben - in dem ich jetzt selbst ein Zimmer in München zur Verfügung stelle.

Allgemein  bin ein sportlicher Mensch der gerne unterwegs ist und neue Leute kennenlernt! 

Ich freu mich auch euch kennenzulernen :)
