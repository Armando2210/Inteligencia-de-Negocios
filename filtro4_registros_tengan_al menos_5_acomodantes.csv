Es öffnet sehr die Einstellung zum Leben. So ist für mich Rassismus unverständlich. Ich bin pazifistisch eingestellt, denn Konflikte kann man immer mit Diplomatie lösen.
Neben meinem Beruf bin ich sozial engagiert als Judotrainer und als Freiwilliger für Stammzellentransporte von Leukämiepatienten.
In der Freizeit gehe ich gerne wandern, Rad fahren, schwimmen und mache Judo. Gerne würde ich wieder mehr Basketball spielen.
Beruflich bin ich Softwareingenieur und programmiere sehr gerne Handelssysteme in der Programmiersprache Java.

Beside my job I am engaged as a Judo coach and I am volunteering for stem cell transports for leukaemia patients.
